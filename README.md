> Anticloud-hardened packaging of the upstream project `SOLPY` in category **SOLAR**. Upstream source is vendored in `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` at the pinned commit below; the 12-improvement overlay lives in `anticloud/`. Every fact in this file traces to a file on disk in this project directory.

**Category:** SOLAR · **Upstream:** https://github.com/the-anticloud/anticloud-solpy.git · **Upstream pin:** `7d65b66c123f83f51d410416c46c424790389c48` · **Vendor:** Anticloud FZ LLE

## What This Project Does

**SOLPY** is an open-source project in the **SOLAR** category, vendored into the Anticloud project at a pinned upstream commit and hardened with the standard 12-improvement overlay (see the Benchmarks section).

The upstream snapshot ships a short readme note:

Project-specific facts detected in this directory:

- Ecosystem: **Unknown (no standard manifest detected)** (manifests: none detected; scanned in UPSTREAM_CLONE)
- Snapshot size: **3 files**, **48 lines of code** (measured; see Benchmarks)
- Primary languages: `(none)` (1), `.md` (1), `.py` (1)
- Upstream commit pinned for this packaging: `7d65b66c123f83f51d410416c46c424790389c48`

## Installation

No installation section was found in the upstream readme, so the commands below are generated from the manifests detected in this project directory.

```sh
# No standard manifest detected. Inspect UPSTREAM_CLONE/ for the upstream
# build system (Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, configure, ...) and follow it.
```

Overlay install (this project):

```sh
python -m pip install -e anticloud/     # overlay package with the 12 improvements
python anticloud/cli.py --help          # 13 subcommands, JSON stdout
```

---

## Usage

No usage section was found in the upstream readme. Entry points detected in this project directory:

Browse the snapshot layout listed under What This Project Does and follow the upstream run instructions for the detected ecosystem (Unknown (no standard manifest detected)).

Anticloud overlay CLI (available in every project):

```sh
python anticloud/cli.py --help     # 13 subcommands, JSON stdout
python anticloud/cli.py checks     # run the 16-check suite
```

---

## API

The upstream API surface is defined by the `SOLPY` source tree vendored in `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` (Unknown (no standard manifest detected) ecosystem). Public entry points:

- Overlay API: `anticloud/cli.py` exposes 13 subcommands with JSON stdout; `anticloud/bench/runner.py` runs the 16-check suite; `anticloud/provenance/chain.py` exposes the SHA3-256 + Ed25519 provenance chain.

## Dependencies

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ecosystem | Unknown (no standard manifest detected) |
| Manifests detected | none |
| Files in snapshot | 3 |
| Lines of code | 48 |
| Dependency references | 0 |
| Upstream license | MIT |
| Overlay license | Anticommons 0.1.0 |

Pinned lockfile: `anticloud/requirements.lock` (hash-pinned, PEP 508). SBOM: `sbom.cdx.json` (CycloneDX 1.5, pinned to the upstream SHA).

---

## Configuration

No configuration section was found in the upstream readme. Configuration-relevant files detected in this project directory:

- None detected at the snapshot root; consult the upstream documentation link in the Upstream section.

Overlay configuration (Anticloud):

- `anticloud/` - improvement overlay; environment-driven, no cloud dependency
- `LEDGERS/` - aioss tamper-evident chain files (per-project, verified with `aioss verify --live`)
- `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/` - reproducibility record (environment, reproduction steps, result register, evidence)
- `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` - 26 framework assessments for this project

---

## Contributing

Upstream contributions: fork the `SOLPY` project, create a feature branch, and open a pull request against upstream. Keep `UPSTREAM_CLONE/` untouched in this packaging; put improvements in the `anticloud/` overlay.

Overlay contributions: run the 16-check suite before opening a pull request:

```sh
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

## Benchmarks

Measured by the Anticloud assurance suite. Every value below is read from this
project's `BENCH.json`, produced by a real run — the SHA3-256 of that file is
`908b8b163f39f15cc2e137cac787cbf8fbf3c838e421364a508ae5b72db820f7`.

**Overall: 16/16 checks passing.**

See `ISOLATED_LAB_RESULTS/03_Result_Register.md` for the 16-check register with pass condition, command and observed value per check.

Framework folders in `OFFICIAL_BENCHMARKS/` state the control set and the
evidence source bound to each control. This project does not claim an audit
opinion, a SOC report, a FedRAMP authorisation or a PCI attestation — those are
issued by an independent assessor.
